# Predict the falls!

## 

![](assets/2-falls-cpm/the-fig.png){.absolute height="600"}

## Objective:

- Develop and validate a prediction model for inpatient falls


## Methods:

- Time-to-event (Cox regression) model with updates throughout admission
- Routine Electronic Medical Records data only
- Good model assessment methods
- Good reporting
- Predictions through to first 14 days of admission

## Data


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(flextable)
tbl <- readRDS("assets/2-falls-cpm/tbl-summary.rds")

tbl
```


## Data

```{r}
bg(tbl, i = 1, j = 2:8, bg = "yellow", part = "body")
```

## Data

```{r}
bg(tbl, i = 4, bg = "yellow", part = "body")
```

## Data

```{r}
bg(tbl, i = 7, bg = "yellow", part = "body")
```


## Cross-validation

```{r}
tbl <- readRDS("assets/2-falls-cpm/tbl-power-by-fold.rds")

tbl
```


## Discrimination

## Calibration

## Summary

- Highly discriminant inpatient falls prediction model
- Calibration not ideal but may be be best suited to assign treatment rather than provide risk estimates
- First use of time-to-event model in inpatient falls prediction with time-varying covariates
- One of the largest datasets and first use of internal-external cross-validation
