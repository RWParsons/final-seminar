## Significance

::: {.incremental}

- Reviewed falls prediction model development literature
- Developed a new falls prediction model using new (to falls) methods and best practice
- Developed a new cutpoint selection method to align CDSS with value-based care
- Developed software to direct prediction model research and implementation efforts towards those that are likely to be worthwhile

:::

## Future Research

- What are the estimated benefits of using a time-to-event model versus the current prediction models?
- How well can neural networks which model survival outcomes perform compared to the proposed Cox model?
