## Significance

::: {.incremental}

- Highlighted problems and gaps with existing clinical prediction models for inpatient falls
- Developed a new model addressing gaps identified
- Provided a new cutpoint selection method for wider range of uses
- Released new software which can be used to hone prediction development and implementation efforts

:::

## Limitations

- No estimate or evaluation of whether proposed model will help patients or resource allocation
- All CDSS rely on availability of good interventions

## Future Research

- What are the estimated patient and resource allocation benefits of using the proposed model?
- How well can neural networks which model survival outcomes perform compared to the proposed Cox model?
