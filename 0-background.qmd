## Why falls?

:::{.incremental}
- Falls are bad
  - length of stay increased by 8 days^1^
  - 1 in 3 fallers injured^2^

- Falls have a huge economic burden
  - most prevalent adverse event in hospitals (3.6%)^1^
  - $6700 in additional healthcare costs^1^

## Problematic prediction models

![](assets/0-background/leaky-pipe.png)

## This PhD

:::{.incremental}

**How can we make a good prediction model for inpatient falls?**

1. Review existing clinical prediction models for inpatient falls
2. Develop a prediction model for inpatient falls

**How can we better align prediction models with objectives of the users?**

3. Develop a cutpoint selection method to align CDSS with value-based care
4. Develop software to determine when/where prediction models are most worthwhile
