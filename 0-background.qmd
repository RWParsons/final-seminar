### Aims/Studies

:::{.incremental}

1. Review existing clinical prediction models for inpatient falls.
2. Develop a prediction model for inpatient falls.
3. Develop a cutpoint selection method to align CDSS with value-based care.
4. Develop software to determine when/where prediction models are most worthwhile.
