## Cutpoint selection methods

All maximise a performance based metric (not outcome)^1^

- Youden index

- Sens-Spec product

- Index of Union

- The Closest to (0, 1) Criteria

:::{.incremental}
- Cost-minimising
  - *Only one to consider anything beyond the model itself (costs, patient outcomes, interventions)*

## Objectives

- Integrate information of patient outcomes and treatment costs into cutpoint selection

>- Evaluate how it compares to other cutpoint selection methods in health economic terms

## Proposed "value-optimising" cutpoint method

New custom method using `{cutpointr}` to maximise Net Monetary Benefit (NMB): 

$$NMB ($) = \text{resources} + \text{(monetised) health benefits}$$

::: custom-xsmall

```{r, echo=F}
data.frame(
  row.names = c("Actually Positive", "Actually Negative"),
  P_Positive = c(
    "$NMB_{TP}$", 
    "$NMB_{FP}$"
  ), 
  P_Negative = c(
    "$NMB_{FN}$",
    "$NMB_{TN}$"
  )
) |>
  rename("Predicted Positive" = P_Positive,
         "Predicted Negative" = P_Negative) |>

## Simulation study inputs

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
- **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost due to falls ~ 0.04** 
  (Latimer et al. 2013) and has an approximate distribution of:
  $$\mathrm{B}(\alpha = 2.95, \beta = 32.25)$$  

- **Additional healthcare costs ~ \$6700** (Morello et
  al. 2015) and follows an approximate distribution of:
  $$\Gamma (\alpha = 22.05, \beta = 0.0033) $$

- *Falls prevention intervention*
  - **Costs = \$77.3**(Hill et al. 2015)
  - **Reduces falls by ~ 45%** (Haines et al. 2011) and the log
    hazard ratio follows an approximate distribution of:
    $$\mathcal{N}(\mu = -0.844, \sigma = 0.304) $$

- Willingness to pay = $28033

## Evaluation

- Simulate datasets and fitting of prediction model
- Evaluate model decisions using each cutpoint method in terms of NMB 

... repeat

## Results - NMB

## Results - robust to poor calibration

## Summary

- Proposed value-optimising cutpoint can incorporate clinical context to select cutpoint that maximises the Net Monetary Benefit
- Implications for wider range of decision support systems
- Similar to cost-minimising but robust to poor model calibration
- Presented visually as a Shiny app for visualising differences between methods
