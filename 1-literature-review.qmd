## Objectives

- Summarise existing data and methods used to develop inpatient falls prediction models
  - Sources of data
  - Model development algorithms
  - Evaluation methods
  - Reporting quality

## Included studies

<!-- # add prisma diagram -->

## The typical

<!-- logistic regression/tree based model predicting 1+ falls in admission using data at admission -->

## The less typical

<!-- - predicting next day falls -->
<!-- - using 2x2 matrix to select cutpoint -->
<!-- rare use of external validation -->

# Gaps


## How to make a model differently

## better ways to select a cutpoint?
