## Objectives

- Summarise existing data and methods used to develop inpatient falls prediction models
  - Sources of data
  - Model development algorithms
  - Evaluation methods
  - Reporting quality

## Included studies

## The typical study

Data:

::: {.incremental}

- Available at admission
- Collected via survey/questionnaire
- Variables included previous falls, age, sex, mental state, or physical function assessments
- Case-control sampling to balance fallers and non-fallers

:::

## The typical study

Modelling:

::: {.incremental}
- Logistic regression
- Outcome: one or more falls during admission
- Predictions made at or soon after admission

:::

## The typical study

::: {.incremental}

Validation methods:

- Bad

Reporting: 

- Worse

## The not-so-typical

- Two studies predicted falls within the next 24-hour period and made new predictions each day of admission^1^
- Considered relative cost of false negatives to false positives to select prediction model cutpoint^2^

# Gaps

- Almost no use of time-to-event models to estimate falls risk
- Almost no models updated throughout admission or whenever new data is available
- Relatively few studies relied solely on routine, electronic data
