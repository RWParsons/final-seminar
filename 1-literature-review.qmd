## Objectives

Summarise existing data and methods used to develop inpatient falls prediction models:

  - Sources of data
  - Model development algorithms
  - Evaluation methods
  - Reporting quality (TRIPOD)

## Included studies

## The typical included study

Data:

::: {.incremental}

- Available at admission
- Collected via questionnaires
- Variables included previous falls, age, sex, mental state, or physical function assessments
- Case-control sampling to balance fallers and non-fallers

:::

## The typical included study

Modelling:

::: {.incremental}
- Logistic regression
- Predictions made at or soon after admission
- Outcome: one or more falls during admission

:::

## The typical included study

::: {.incremental}

Validation methods (selection of validation datasets):

- Bad

Reporting (TRIPOD): 

- Worse

## Data sampling

## Reporting - Adherence to TRIPOD

## The not-so-typical

- Two studies predicted falls within the next 24-hour period and made new predictions each day of admission^1^
- Considered relative cost of false negatives to false positives to select prediction model cutpoint^2^

## Gaps

- Models that better consider time to event
- Updating predictions when data is available
- Rely solely on routinely collected electronic data
